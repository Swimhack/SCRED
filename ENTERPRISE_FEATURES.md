## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Feature Flag System
1. Implement `FEATURE_FLAGS.ts` configuration
2. Wrap enterprise features with feature flags
3. Add environment-based feature control

### Phase 2: Route Simplification  
1. Remove enterprise routes from `App.tsx`
2. Simplify `ProtectedRoute` to single admin role
3. Update navigation to hide enterprise links

### Phase 3: Component Hiding
1. Wrap enterprise components with feature flags
2. Create simplified versions of complex components
3. Update hooks to disable enterprise functionality

### Phase 4: Database Schema
1. Use RLS policies to hide enterprise tables
2. Create MVP-specific database views
3. Maintain enterprise schema structure for future restoration

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
1. Test MVP functionality without enterprise features
2. Validate that all UI elements still work
3. Ensure enterprise features can be easily restored

---

## Restoration Guidelines

### When Client Upgrades to Enterprise:
1. Set `ENTERPRISE_MODE = true` in feature flags
2. Enable enterprise routes in router configuration
3. Activate enterprise database policies
4. Configure external services (email, SMS, AI)
5. Train users on enterprise features

### Development Workflow:
1. Never delete enterprise code - only hide it
2. Use feature flags consistently
3. Document any changes to enterprise features
4. Test both MVP and enterprise modes regularly

---

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a complete roadmap for converting the current enterprise application to an MVP while preserving all enterprise functionality for future restoration. The feature flag approach ensures that enterprise features remain intact and can be quickly activated when the client is ready to upgrade.

The key principle is **hide, don't delete** - maintaining the sophisticated enterprise architecture while presenting a simplified interface for MVP users.
