## 🔄 What Was NOT Migrated (And Why)

### Feature Flags Approach
**Old Repo**: Hardcoded role checks in sidebar component  
**New Repo**: Dynamic feature flag system

**Why this is better:**
- More flexible and maintainable
- Easier to enable/disable features per environment
- Supports MVP and Enterprise modes
- Better separation of concerns

### Unchanged Core Features
The following were already present and working in SCRED:
- ✅ Dashboard with statistics
- ✅ Pharmacist management (Total, Pending, Completed, Expiring)
- ✅ PharmacistTable component
- ✅ StatCard components with clickable links
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Authentication system
- ✅ Profile management
- ✅ My Applications / My Credentials / My Expiring pages
